This contains all of my settings that I wish to be usable on multiple machines. 

So far I have a themable HLWM, and a few bits and bobs. I will continue to add everything I do so that this repo stays up to date. This is not for your benefit, but mine ;). 

Feel free to use anything you see here any way you want. If you find a way to monetize it, I would be very impressed, but still expect a consideration. I think that a few beers, or a personal jet are fair compensation.
